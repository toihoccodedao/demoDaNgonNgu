    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>The customer is very important, the customer will be followed by the customer. I don't even drive vehicles sometimes,
and easy drinks to drink. It's a free valley truck, or a chocolate bar of life. The boat was just poisoned.
But from the lake and the great warmth of the developers. Complete mourning. I read but sometimes the chocolate,
it was just a simple wisdom, and it is not important that there is no ecstasy.

There is no pellentesque or pure arrows, a tincidunt fear eleifend. He wanted to be in the industry just limits,
but the eleifend wants to drink. Curabitur et eros eu lorem lacinia ultrices a ac eros.

The vast meadow spread endlessly, a sea of flowers swaying in the gentle breeze, whispering secrets of timeless beauty.
Above, the golden sun bathed the world in warmth, and beneath its rays, the earth seemed alive with vibrant energy.

But deep within, a quiet melancholy lingered, a yearning for something beyond the horizon. The developers toiled tirelessly,
their hands crafting dreams into reality. They paused only briefly, savoring the bitter sweetness of a stolen chocolate moment.

The river flowed steadily, a silent witness to the passage of time. Its waters carried stories of triumph and despair,
its surface reflecting both the light of hope and the shadows of uncertainty.

The forest echoed with the chirping of birds, each note a melody that filled the heart with both joy and longing.
It was here, amidst nature's embrace, that one could find solace from the chaos of the industry’s relentless march.

And yet, within the stillness, there was movement—a deer leapt gracefully, its elegance a reminder of life’s fleeting beauty.
Nearby, the wind rustled the leaves, its whisper mingling with the laughter of children playing by the lake's edge.

Dreams, like the blossoms on the trees, bloomed for a moment before falling to the ground, leaving behind a bittersweet memory.
Curabitur et eros eu lorem lacinia ultrices a ac eros. Each step taken forward was accompanied by a glance backward,
a dance of hope and nostalgia. The journey never ends, for the heart always yearns for more.

As the twilight descended, the sky painted itself in hues of orange and violet, a canvas of nature's artistry.
The stars began to flicker, faint at first, then boldly illuminating the heavens with their eternal glow.

A distant owl called out, its haunting hoot resonating across the quiet landscape. Its voice carried a sense of mystery,
an echo of the ancient stories the night would never reveal.

Beneath the vast sky, the earth seemed smaller, yet filled with infinite wonders. Each stone, tree, and ripple in the water
held a story, waiting to be discovered by those who dared to pause and listen.

The whispers of the wind carried the promise of new adventures, an invitation to explore the unknown paths that lay ahead.
But the heart, content for a moment, found joy in simply being present—breathing in the beauty of a life that flowed like a river.

The world spun on, indifferent yet magnificent, a delicate balance of chaos and harmony. Time stood still,
and in that stillness, life’s true meaning became clear: to cherish the fleeting moments, to dream, and to keep moving forward.</value>
